# SensoTec
## Description
SensoTec is a technology-based company focused on the development of software for sensors, mainly oriented toward the agricultural sector. We design platforms that allow the collection, visualization, and analysis of data in real time, enabling soil and environmental monitoring to optimize processes such as irrigation and resource usage.
## Motivation
My motivation for creating this project comes from my background in a farming family. San Quintín is one of the regions with strong agricultural activity, but it has limited technological innovation. This project aims to bring accessible and practical technological solutions to improve agricultural practices.
